# week3-Assignment-build-cookie-clicker

I enjoyed building the cookie clicker game this week. The main things I struggled on or should I say took up alot of my time was trying to figure out how to get my buttons to function and also the timer trying to get that to function on the screen rather than just on my console but having a coversation with a team member and looking back at the old workshops and having a look online I managed to figure it out. The only thing I havent managed to do is the button that is meant to increase each time I buy an item on my upgrades list!
